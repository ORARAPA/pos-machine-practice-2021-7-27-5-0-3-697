Function name: getValuesFromBarcode
P: 20min
D: 35min 24s
C: 1. Little knowledge on lists, need to search a lot of methods on how to implement 2. Took a lot of time in searching and less on coding
A: 1. Review more on lists 2. Need to improve on time

Function name: countQuantity
P: 5min
D: 3min 19s
C: 1. Counting inside a list is just the same as with arrays 2. Good in the time, should maintain it
A: 1. Should do easier tasks first to not take a long time

Function name:  calculateSubtotal
P: 20min
D: 30min 24s
C: 1. Had to change it a lot since I was doing long codes instead of using previous functions 2. Added parameter to lessen line of codes
A: 1. Keep on basing in context map alone making it hard to modify classes instead of just adding parameters

Function name:  calculateTotal
P: 5min
D: 3min 2s
C: 1. Experience in calculateSubtotal was useful that it lessen the things to do and to integrate created functions 2. Time was less than expected
A: 1. Learn from previous mistakes 2. Keep time within planned

Function name: calculate
P: 2min
D: 37s
C: 1. Integration of previous functions is well used 
A: 1. May use fewer line of codes 2. Maintain the time which is less than planned

Function name: renderReceipt
P: 5min
D: 15min, 8s
C: 1. Encountered erros in printing: didn't produce expected results 2. Issues on variables were found
A: 1. Check closely per function if all will produce what is expected


Actions: Try to keep time as much as possible to the planned; Closely check on what are expected outputs on each function to avoid finding erros at the end; Parameters can adjust to make coding easier
